# OneDrive-Killer
My friends computer kept getting clogged up by OneDrive taking up over 2GB of ram. Because I always overcomplicate things, I wrote a program to ensure its always closed.

If you want to use this, make sure it opens during startup.

Also, due to the exact code, it only works as an exe file. If you want to change this, replace the ".exe" with ".py" in both files - changing "OneDrive Closer.exe" to "OneDrive Closer.py" and "OneDrive Closer Observer.exe" to "OneDrive Closer Observer.py"

If you use the exe files you don't need to worry about this

This is split into 2 exe versions. I used pyinstaller to convert it to solo exe files. The "Console Version" means it opens both exe files with a console window, easier for debugging. Sometimes the applications close and open eachother so to stop these popping up infront of applications or games, don't use the "Console Version"

The "Dependency Installer.bat" will automatically install the dependencies if their not installed. This is only needed if you are using the .py version

Also, this is my first GitHub submission so be kind :3 if you need to contact me, you can find me on Discord at "phederal_phoenix" or at linktr.ee/annaspanner
